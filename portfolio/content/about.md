Hey there. I'm Jacob. I'm a software engineer with a bachelors degree in computer science. I operate in many software domains; including but not limited to: 
[graphics](/tags/graphics), 
[web](/tags/web),
[systems](/tags/systems),
[languages](/tags/languages),
and, [game development](/tags/game-development). 

I care a lot about [open source software](/tags/open-source), [education](/tags/education), and [sustainable software practices](/tags/sustainabilit). 

My favorite languages are -  [Rust](/tags/rust)<span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify"></span> <code>:crab:</code></span>, 
[Typescript](/tags/typescript), 
[C#](/tags/c#), 
and [Go/Golang](/tags/golang).
I'm also comfortable with working in any of the "C descended languages" such as C++, PHP, Perl, etc.

To see what languages and frameworks I've worked with professionally, [reach out to me](/contact/) for my resume.

Now go check out some of my [projects](/projects/), [read my blog](/posts/), [play some of my games]().
